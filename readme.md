=== Using Erlang in typography applications

=== INTRODUCTION


  ErlGuten.  is  a system  for  hiqh quality  typesetting,
ErlGuten  is  free software.   ErlGuten  aims  to produce  typographic
quality PDF directly from XML or from a program.

   The aim of ErlGuten is to produce high quality PDF from a layout
language  or from  a program.   The ErlGuten  distribution  includes a
programming  API, so  that Erlang  programs can  produce PDF  -  and a
typesetting system for typesetting documents written in XML.

  The  name  ErlGuten  is chosen  because  the program  is
written  in  Erlang  -  the  Guten part  is  a  reference  to
Gutenberg the father of printing.

  ErlGuten is a  system for high quality typesetting,  so we take a
great  deal  of   care  when  formatting  text,  a   large  number  of
optimizations are  performed which improve the quality  of the printed
text.  Many of these optimizations are usually only found in expensive
professional type-setting programs.   We believe that WYSIWYG programs
have  destroyed the fine  art of  typesetting -  ErlGuten is  a modest
attempt to improve the situation.

  We have  chosen XML as the  input language for  it's wide appeal.
XML provides only a thin abstraction layer over the typesetting system
- so the adventurous  can use the programming interface  to ErlGuten -
to directly  produce typographic quality PDF in  real-time.  We expect
this facility  to be  useful for the  dynamic generation  of documents
from web-servers.

  In  ErlGuten  we  take  the   view  that  the  highest  level  of
abstraction  is  the layout  of  a  document  - we  are  very
concerned  that the user  can specify  the exact  position of
text on  the printed  page. At  the next level  of abstraction  we are
concerned with the typefaces that are used to format different regions
of the document.

  ErlGuten  is designed  for the  production of  large  and complex
documents with  complex layout requirements,  like newspapers
or  books.    In  ErlGuten  layout,   content,  and  document
management  are  considered separate  issues.  Layout is  template
based -  Content is  assumed to  be stored as  a large  number of
documents in  a file  system or data  base, document  management is
considered  as  a mapping  operation  which  takes  documents in  the
content  data base  and  maps  them onto  templates  to produce  hight
quality output.

  This  is normal text,  set 30  picas wide  in 12/14  Times Roman.
Many   different   typefaces  can   be   used   within  a   paragraph.
Emphasized text is set in Times-Italic.  Hyphenation uses the
TeX hyphenation algorithm.  Any of  the 35 built-in PDF typefaces with
the  same  point  size  can  be  mixed with  a  paragraph.   The  term
{person,"Joe"} is  an Erlang term which  has been typeset
in 12  point courier.  The  paragraph justification algorithm
does  proper  kerning  so,  for  example, the  word  AWAY  is
correctly kerned!  - line breaks  within a paragraph are selected by a
sophisticated global optimization technique.
