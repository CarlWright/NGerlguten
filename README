1) Install with make

2) try the command

   ./erlguten test1.xml

   This produces test1.pdf
   
   
   If you are  building this without the help of "make", you'll need to compile all the /src files, 
   run "eg_afm:make()" and run "eg_mk_hyphen:start()".
   
   These build font .erl files in /priv/src that all need to be compile to get font information. 
   You also need to compile the /src/eg_hyphen_rules* files so that hyphenation will also work.
