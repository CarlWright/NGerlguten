1) The NGerlguten project is built with sinan, an Erlang OTP  oriented build system. If you can sinan installed, you can just "sinan build" to make NGerlguten.

2) Run "sinan build" twice. The second time is runs eg_afm and eg_mk_hyphen to make additional modules that include the fonts and the hyphenation dictionaries.


NOte:  If you can't use "sinan", you can compile all the .erl files manually. You'll also need to run some of them to create more 
modules for fonts. You'll need to run eg_afm to prepare font modules and run eg_mk_hyphen to create the hyphenation 
modules and dictionaries. THen compile the modules that these two programs make.

The edoc data can be produced by running "erl" in the <em>base directory</em> and using the following command:

    edoc:application('NGerlguten',".",[{def,{version,"2.6"}},{dir,"./doc/edoc"},{stylesheet_file, ".//doc/eg_stylesheet.css"}]). 
    
    Change the version number string to the correct value. The dir entry in the command
    will put the documentation in /doc/edoc.
