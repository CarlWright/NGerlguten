Victorias-Secret is a Type 1 PostScript font constructed from the 
handwriting (printing, mostly) of Victoria Salter, the Office Manager of 
the Columbia University Music Department. Note the extra swashes on the 
upper-case E. You'll find every character Victoria routinely uses, 
including alphabet, numbers and punctuation.

Victorias-Secret is copyright (c) 1992 by David Rakowski. All Rights

accompanies any copies sold or traded. Commercial distribution is 
prohibited. Nonprofit companies and user groups may freely distribute this 
font on their nominal charge disks.

Victorias-Secret comes from the zero-person type foundry fictitiously known 
as Insect Bytes. Although we don't understand it when other people say it, 
we also claim that our fonts are "hand crafted." We feel that calling a 
digital typeface "hand crafted" is somewhat akin to calling a television 
"mother."
