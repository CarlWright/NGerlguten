These two fonts are samples from our OCR-A/OCR-B font package.  OCR-A-Digits 
and OCR-B-Digits include only the digits 0-9 and the space character.  They 
are ideal for inventory, ID numbers, tracking, etc., and they serve as a demo 
of our full OCR-A/OCR-B font set which includes the full ASCII character set.  
It is only $99 and available directly from us.

Install the TrueType font using the Control Panel/Fonts from the Program 
Manager.  Install the Type 1 fonts using the ATM Control Panel.  They will then 
appear in the font menu of any Windows application.
