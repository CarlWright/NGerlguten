  <p><em>ErlGuten.</em>  is  a system  for  hiqh quality  typesetting,
ErlGuten  is  free software.   ErlGuten  aims  to produce  typographic
quality PDF directly from XML or from a program.</p>

  <p> The aim of ErlGuten is to produce high quality PDF from a layout
language  or from  a program.   The ErlGuten  distribution  includes a
programming  API, so  that Erlang  programs can  produce PDF  -  and a
typesetting system for typesetting documents written in XML.</p>

  <p>The document that you are reading was authored in XML and typeset
by  ErlGuten. The  name  ErlGuten  is chosen  because  the program  is
written  in  Erlang  -  the  <em>Guten</em> part  is  a  reference  to
<em>Gutenberg</em> the father of printing.</p>

  <p>ErlGuten is a  system for high quality typesetting,  so we take a
great  deal  of   care  when  formatting  text,  a   large  number  of
optimizations are  performed which improve the quality  of the printed
text.  Many of these optimizations are usually only found in expensive
professional type-setting programs.   We believe that WYSIWYG programs
have  destroyed the fine  art of  typesetting -  ErlGuten is  a modest
attempt to improve the situation.</p>

  <p>We have  chosen XML as the  input language for  it's wide appeal.
XML provides only a thin abstraction layer over the typesetting system
- so the adventurous  can use the programming interface  to ErlGuten -
to directly  produce typographic quality PDF in  real-time.  We expect
this facility  to be  useful for the  dynamic generation  of documents
from web-servers.</p>

  <p>In  ErlGuten  we  take  the   view  that  the  highest  level  of
abstraction  is  the <em>layout</em>  of  a  document  - we  are  very
concerned  that the user  can specify  the <em>exact</em>  position of
text on  the printed  page. At  the next level  of abstraction  we are
concerned with the typefaces that are used to format different regions
of the document.</p>

  <p>ErlGuten  is designed  for the  production of  large  and complex
documents with  complex layout requirements,  like <em>newspapers</em>
or  <em>books</em>.    In  ErlGuten  layout,   content,  and  document
management  are  considered separate  issues.  Layout is  <em>template
based</em> -  Content is  assumed to  be stored as  a large  number of
documents in  a file  system or data  base, document  management is
considered  as  a mapping  operation  which  takes  documents in  the
content  data base  and  maps  them onto  templates  to produce  hight
quality output.</p>

  <p>This  is normal text,  set 30  picas wide  in 12/14  Times Roman.
Many   different   typefaces  can   be   used   within  a   paragraph.
<em>Emphasized text</em> is set in Times-Italic.  Hyphenation uses the
TeX hyphenation algorithm.  Any of  the 35 built-in PDF typefaces with
the  same  point  size  can  be  mixed with  a  paragraph.   The  term
<code>{person,"Joe"}</code> is  an Erlang term which  has been typeset
in 12  point <em>courier</em>.  The  paragraph justification algorithm
does  proper  <em>kerning</em>  so,  for  example, the  word  AWAY  is
correctly kerned!  - line breaks  within a paragraph are selected by a
sophisticated global optimization technique.</p>
