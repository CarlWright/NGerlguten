The example programs show ways of using the NGerlguten software and test the correct operation of features of the package.

The programs eg_test10 and eg_test12 process a complex PNG graphic file. Warning: they run slowly enough to make you think that they have an infinite loop. 

The programs read in files from the "testing" folder and sub-ordinate folders. To work with changes, you need to be in the   $HOME/NGerlguten/_build/ngerlguten/lib/ng_examples-0.1.0/ebin folder for the file references to work correctly.
